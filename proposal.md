# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Rv's content mod

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A mod that adds a few items like weapons and tools.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The mod will add multiple weapons and tools. I want to make weapons that follow the proggresion in the game. I'm going to make tools that follow this progression too. Some of the weapons and tools will have unique projectiles. I going to do this though the official terraria mod loader TmodLoader. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Weapons and tools

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Weapons, tools, armor. The weapons having unique projectiles.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Weapons and tools with both the weapons and tolls having unique projectiles. An armor set, NPC, and boss.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn how to read the coding language that terraria uses. I will need to research how to put in models and textures. I will also need to learn how to program NPC AI. I will need to go to the Tmod loader web site to look up how to mod. I'll also need to figure out how the player should obtain the items and what they are crafted from. I need to figure out how to add crafting recipes to items.
